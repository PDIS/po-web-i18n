# Open Gov ======================================================================

opengov:
  what:
    title: What is open government?
    content0: The open government was proposed by an international organization called the OGP (Open Government Partnership). 
    content1: 「......Adhering to open value and engaging with citizens to improve services, manage public resources, drive innovation and build safer communities. With the principle of transparency and open government, we will achieve prosperity, well-being and a society in line with human dignity in our own country and in an increasingly connected world.......」
    content2: The four visions of an open government—the future we look forward to—are transparency, participation, responsibility, and tolerance.
  
  why:
    title: Why should there be an open government? 
    content: "The higher the trust base is between the public sector and the public, the better the chance for sound public policies. Vice versa: A lack of mutual trust can lead to a loss of focus of discussion and public policy wobbles, with huge social costs. Therefore, <a class=\"text-highlight\">the mutual trust between the public sector and the public is the ultimate goal of an open government.</a>"

  how:
    title: How to promote an open government? 
    content: <a class="text-highlight">To promote open government, we must start by changing the culture of public service. </a> If civil servants who are actually driving the policy can be the locomotive and take the initiative to adopt more open methods and thinking to produce policies, over the term, the policy can take the right direction as soon as possible, and it can also help accomplish things better. In other words, changing the culture of public service is like sewer engineering, which, while invisible, must make significant change over the long run.

  who:
    title: Who will advocate for an open government? 
    content: An open government is everyone's business, so we need people who are willing to participate in the policy drive process, the civil servants who can share practical experiences, and the administrative officers who can take responsibility; So the "open government contact" appointed by the ministries, or PO (Participation Officer), is the "seed" of changing the culture of public service and fertilizing deeply open government.

  points:
    title: The four elements of an open government
    content: What is an open government? To put it simply, in the process of making public policies, the four elements of transparency, participation, responsibility, and tolerance are gradually fused. That is the way to implement an open government. But specifically, what should be done?
    list:
      - title: Transparency
        img: 1 _ 透明.png
        content: Politics is everyone's business, and the policy process should allow the public to have a clear understanding of "what's going on." Friends in the public sector may be worried whether there will be any problems if we let the outside world see the communications before it's finished. In fact, the earlier the information is provided, the easier it is for the public to understand what the public sector is preparing for, so that the public sector can save the effort and time of repeated communication and further reduce the communication burden.
      - title: Participation
        img: 1 _ 參與.png
        content: In the process of policy formation, the public is given the opportunity to participate in discussions, express opinions, and even further influence the content of policy on topics of interest. As a result, while the public sector needs to spend more time building consensus, when the policy takes shape, it is less likely to be opposed by the public or totally objected. 
      - title: Accountability
        img: 1 _ 課責.png
        content: When the public has doubts about the process of policy formation, we can look back to see who does and what are the reasons
      - title: Inclusion
        img: 1 _ 涵容.png
        content: Public issues are broadly oriented. In the course of discussion of an issue, if the public sector is able to allow the various stakeholders who are directly affected by policy to fully voice their views and able to listen to their dialogues, it can collect as many views as possible so as to reduce the likelihood of policy errors.
    summary: The above mentioned four elements shall be linked together in order to achieve the vision of an open government. If there is only transparency, but no responsibility, or if there is participation without tolerance, serious problems will arise. There is only a superficial openness, but no spirit of openness. It will become an "open washing."

  link-to-po: Participation Officers

# Participation Officers ========================================================

po:
  what-is-po-network: 
    title: What is Participation Officers
    content: Participation Officers, abbreviated as a "PO". All the POs form a "PO Network," which is in cooperation with each other to promote the cooperation of the various ministries.
  
  po-network-build-up:
    title: How is a PO produced? 
    content: According to "the Executive Yuan and its subordinate organs of open government participation officers implementation points," at least one person is appointed by each agency. Usually, they are colleagues in public relations, comprehensive regulations, examination management, or information. They may also form a group to act together.
  
  what-po-do:
    title: What does a PO do? 
    content: The most important task is to assist the public sector to listen to the opinions of the non-specific public, and even to plan policies in cooperation. The most important source of the non-specific public may be the vast number of netizens, but it may also be the people who have less Internet access. So what are the qualities of POs? We recommend that POs have a passion for public communication, be familiar with policy content, and make good use of web tools.
  
  skills:
    title: What skills do POs need? 
    content: POs need to take some time to learn the following techniques and gradually internalize the spirit of an open government in the process of practice.
    list:
      - title: Facilitate
        content: If you want to discuss the policy, you need to meet and discuss in addition to participating in the online dialogue. To help people understand each other in the meeting and find a feasible solution, open government needs the assistance of professional hosting. 
        img: 2 _ 主持.png
      - title: Translate
        content: PO is like a translating machine, helping colleagues in the public sector understand what netizens say, and helping the latter understand what the public sector says. After all, if the two sides have different understandings of the same matter, they will not be able to communicate. 
        img: 2 _ 轉譯.png
      - title: Record
        content: Through text, video, or voice, records make the process of policy communication open and transparent. They not only help build mutual trust, but also allow tracking of policy progress and involve more people. It's like a transparent kitchen and a record of production and marketing that makes people more comfortable with the food.

# Collaborative workshop ========================================================

workshop:
  what: 
    title: What's a collaborative meeting? 
    content: >
      We have mastered the concept of an open government (transparency, participation, responsibility, tolerance), and the seeds of promoting open government (PO), how do we promote public-private collaboration? The way we chose was a collaboration meeting. 


      What is "collaboration"? "Collaboration" is that everyone has different ideas and goals for an issue, but wants to contribute. So everyone talks together, listens to each other, tries to find consensus, and starts thinking about solutions from there. The ultimate hope is that "the outcome of the meeting, though not the one I want most, is not contrary to my philosophy and acceptable." 


      There are various methods and tools for practicing open government. We came up with the "collaboration meeting." Different topic attribute may require different process and form. In any form, the most important remains the spirit of transparency, participation, accountability, and tolerance of an open government.

  intro:
    - title: The purpose of collaborative meetings 
      content: The collaborative meeting is a regular meeting platform that aims to assist the host agencies of each public issue to listen to diverse views and create more opportunities for dialogue between agencies and between the agency and the public. Through collaboration, friends in the public sector and the public can work together to clarify issues and find viable solutions. It also enables ministries to make good use of relevant policy thinking, design, and tools, and gradually familiarize themselves with the spirit of an open government.
    - title: Topics for collaborative meetings
      content: There are many topics suitable for collaboration, including "inter-ministerial policy coordination", "information system building", "pre-policy opinion collection," and so on. Depending on the nature of the issue, the goals that a collaborative meeting can achieve are not necessarily the same. Some issues involve conflict of values, which can be explained to a certain extent through collaborative meetings and can be seen by decision makers; Technical issues can be integrated into the service design process through understanding the views of different stakeholders at collaborative meetings. There are also issues that the public sector is already planning, but people do not necessarily know. Collaborative meetings can inform the public about policy progress, and the public can also provide folk experience for planning reference.
    - title: The challenges of collaborative meetings
      content: Collaborative meetings still face a lot of challenges. In the meetings, listening and discussion among stakeholders is valuable. But, if there is to be sufficient speech and dialogue, there can not be too many participants. Taking into account the time that everyone can speak, for a five-hour meeting, it would be desirable not to have more than forty participants. In addition, the most valuable dialogue process of collaborative meetings is difficult to communicate through written reports or spoken language. As a result, those who do not participate in the collaboration meeting may not be able to understand all the discussions in the collaboration meeting. Or, they read the words in the collaboration meeting and come up with different ideas, resulting in the outcome of the collaboration meeting not necessarily fully communicated. Nor is it guaranteed to be adopted. 

  how:
    title: How to organize a collaborative meeting?
    content: Holding collaborative meetings does not require a lot of engineering, and there is a certain framework to refer to. We encourage public sector friends to use the processes and tools provided by the site to organize collaborative meetings on their own to discuss issues in depth and to work with multiple stakeholders to find solutions.

      content: The Policy Committee, which supervises policy in the open government, reports to the premier and other councillors after collaborative meetings. If there is something suggested or thought by the coordination meeting that can be taken, it will be returned to the Executive Yuan command system. If the Executive Yuan does not have a specific ruling or policy objective, the Ministry will consider whether the various opinions collected at the coordination meeting can be taken into account. If so, they will be included in the policy formation process and dealt with in accordance with the existing administrative procedures.

The remaining meetings shall be allocated to the topics with the highest percentage of votes, with the denominator being the sum of voters among participants and the nominator being the number of votes of individual topics.  All topics must receive at least half of the votes to become a collaborative topic.
        - title: Should one of the undermentioned situations occur, each individual organizing agency shall determine whether a collaborative meeting should be held.
          points: 
            - title: The topic has received more than half of the votes cast, but has not been chosen due to limitations in the number of meetings.
            - title: The topic has not received more than half of the votes cast, but the collaborative topics of the month are less than two.

    - title: "Processing time of the collaborative meetings: This shall be discussed among the organizing agency and PDIS, and the collaborative meetings shall in principle be processed the month following the PO monthly meeting.  Should the collaborative topic be decided by vote, the same organizing agency must not hold a second collaborative meeting within 45 days of the first, unless the organizing agency has approved so, lest other topics that have not been discussed in collaborative meetings be delayed in their processing."
