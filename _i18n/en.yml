# Open Gov ======================================================================

opengov:
  what:
    title: What is open government?
    content0: The open government was proposed by an international organization called the OGP (Open Government Partnership). 
    content1: 「......Adhering to open value and engaging with citizens to improve services, manage public resources, drive innovation and build safer communities. With the principle of transparency and open government, we will achieve prosperity, well-being and a society in line with human dignity in our own country and in an increasingly connected world.......」
    content2: The four visions of an open government—the future we look forward to—are transparency, participation, accountability, and inclusion.
  
  why:
    title: Why should there be an open government? 
    content: "The higher the trust base is between the public sector and the public, the better the chance for sound public policies. Vice versa: A lack of mutual trust can lead to a loss of focus of discussion and public policy wobbles, with huge social costs. Therefore, <a class=\"text-highlight\">the mutual trust between the public sector and the public is the ultimate goal of an open government.</a>"

  how:
    title: How to promote an open government? 
    content: <a class="text-highlight">To promote open government, we must start by changing the culture of public service. </a> If civil servants who are actually driving the policy can be the locomotive and take the initiative to adopt more open methods and thinking to produce policies, over the term, the policy can take the right direction as soon as possible, and it can also help accomplish things better. In other words, changing the culture of public service is like sewer engineering, which, while invisible, must make significant change over the long run.

  who:
    title: Who will advocate for an open government? 
    content: An open government is everyone's business, so we need people who are willing to participate in the policy drive process, the civil servants who can share practical experiences, and the administrative officers who can take the lead on accountability; So the "open government contact" appointed by the ministries, or PO (Participation Officer), is the "seed" of changing the culture of public service and fertilizing deeply open government.

  points:
    title: The four elements of an open government
    content: What is an open government? To put it simply, in the process of making public policies, the four elements of transparency, participation, accountability, and inclusion are gradually fused. That is the way to implement an open government. But specifically, what should be done?
    list:
      - title: Transparency
        img: 1 _ 透明.png
        content: Politics is everyone's business, and the policy process should allow the public to have a clear understanding of "what's going on." Friends in the public sector may be worried whether there will be any problems if we let the outside world see the communications before it's finished. In fact, the earlier the information is provided, the easier it is for the public to understand what the public sector is preparing for, so that the public sector can save the effort and time of repeated communication and further reduce the communication burden.
      - title: Participation
        img: 1 _ 參與.png
        content: In the process of policy formation, the public is given the opportunity to participate in discussions, express opinions, and even further influence the content of policy on topics of interest. As a result, while the public sector needs to spend more time building consensus, when the policy takes shape, it is less likely to be opposed by the public or totally objected. 
      - title: Accountability
        img: 1 _ 課責.png
        content: When the public has doubts about the process of policy formation, we can look back to see who does and what are the reasons
      - title: Inclusion
        img: 1 _ 涵容.png
        content: Public issues are broadly oriented. In the course of discussion of an issue, if the public sector is able to allow the various stakeholders who are directly affected by policy to fully voice their views and able to listen to their dialogues, it can collect as many views as possible so as to reduce the likelihood of policy errors.
    summary: The above mentioned four elements shall be linked together in order to achieve the vision of an open government. If there is only transparency, but no accountability, or if there is participation without inclusion, serious problems will arise. There is only a superficial openness, but no spirit of openness. It will become an "open washing."

  link-to-po: Participation Officers

# Participation Officers ========================================================

po:
  what-is-po-network: 
    title: What is Participation Officers
    content: Participation Officers, abbreviated as a "PO". All the POs form a "PO Network," which is in cooperation with each other to promote the cooperation of the various ministries.
  
  po-network-build-up:
    title: How is a PO produced? 
    content: According to "the Executive Yuan and its subordinate organs of open government participation officers implementation points," at least one person is appointed by each agency. Usually, they are colleagues in public relations, comprehensive regulations, examination management, or information. They may also form a group to act together.
  
  what-po-do:
    title: What does a PO do? 
    content: The most important task is to assist the public sector to listen to the opinions of the non-specific public, and even to plan policies in cooperation. The most important source of the non-specific public may be the vast number of netizens, but it may also be the people who have less Internet access. So what are the qualities of POs? We recommend that POs have a passion for public communication, be familiar with policy content, and make good use of web tools.
  
  skills:
    title: What skills do POs need? 
    content: POs need to take some time to learn the following techniques and gradually internalize the spirit of an open government in the process of practice.
    list:
      - title: Facilitate
        content: If you want to discuss the policy, you need to meet and discuss in addition to participating in the online dialogue. To help people understand each other in the meeting and find a feasible solution, open government needs the assistance of professional hosting. 
        img: 2 _ 主持.png
      - title: Translate
        content: PO is like a translating machine, helping colleagues in the public sector understand what netizens say, and helping the latter understand what the public sector says. After all, if the two sides have different understandings of the same matter, they will not be able to communicate. 
        img: 2 _ 轉譯.png
      - title: Record
        content: Through text, video, or voice, records make the process of policy communication open and transparent. They not only help build mutual trust, but also allow tracking of policy progress and involve more people. It's like a transparent kitchen and a record of production and marketing that makes people more comfortable with the food.

        a: In order to give the PO colleagues rotation opportunities, but also to give more colleagues in the ministry access to the work, it is suggested that the Ministry change the PO every year, but it is not mandatory. The number of consecutive PO colleagues from the first to the second was about 57%. 108 year will be the third.
      - q: How many monthly meetings have been held? 
        a: The first meeting was in March 106 and there were 22 times up to December 107. 
      - q: How many collaborative meetings have been held?

# Collaborative workshop ========================================================

workshop:
  what: 
    title: What's a collaborative meeting? 
    content: >
      We have mastered the concept of an open government (transparency, participation, accountability, inclusion), and the seeds of promoting open government (PO), how do we promote public-private collaboration? The way we chose was a collaboration meeting. 


      What is "collaboration"? "Collaboration" is that everyone has different ideas and goals for an issue, but wants to contribute. So everyone talks together, listens to each other, tries to find consensus, and starts thinking about solutions from there. The ultimate hope is that "the outcome of the meeting, though not the one I want most, is not contrary to my philosophy and acceptable." 


      There are various methods and tools for practicing open government. We came up with the "collaboration meeting." Different topic attribute may require different process and form. In any form, the most important remains the spirit of transparency, participation, accountability, and inclusion of an open government.

  intro:
    - title: The purpose of collaborative meetings 
      content: The collaborative meeting is a regular meeting platform that aims to assist the host agencies of each public issue to listen to diverse views and create more opportunities for dialogue between agencies and between the agency and the public. Through collaboration, friends in the public sector and the public can work together to clarify issues and find viable solutions. It also enables ministries to make good use of relevant policy thinking, design, and tools, and gradually familiarize themselves with the spirit of an open government.
    - title: Topics for collaborative meetings
      content: There are many topics suitable for collaboration, including "inter-ministerial policy coordination", "information system building", "pre-policy opinion collection," and so on. Depending on the nature of the issue, the goals that a collaborative meeting can achieve are not necessarily the same. Some issues involve conflict of values, which can be explained to a certain extent through collaborative meetings and can be seen by decision makers; Technical issues can be integrated into the service design process through understanding the views of different stakeholders at collaborative meetings. There are also issues that the public sector is already planning, but people do not necessarily know. Collaborative meetings can inform the public about policy progress, and the public can also provide folk experience for planning reference.
    - title: The challenges of collaborative meetings
      content: Collaborative meetings still face a lot of challenges. In the meetings, listening and discussion among stakeholders is valuable. But, if there is to be sufficient speech and dialogue, there can not be too many participants. Taking into account the time that everyone can speak, for a five-hour meeting, it would be desirable not to have more than forty participants. In addition, the most valuable dialogue process of collaborative meetings is difficult to communicate through written reports or spoken language. As a result, those who do not participate in the collaboration meeting may not be able to understand all the discussions in the collaboration meeting. Or, they read the words in the collaboration meeting and come up with different ideas, resulting in the outcome of the collaboration meeting not necessarily fully communicated. Nor is it guaranteed to be adopted. 

  how:
    title: How to organize a collaborative meeting?
    content: Holding collaborative meetings does not require a lot of engineering, and there is a certain framework to refer to. We encourage public sector friends to use the processes and tools provided by the site to organize collaborative meetings on their own to discuss issues in depth and to work with multiple stakeholders to find solutions.

# workshop process ====================================================================

workshop-process:
  title: Collaborative Meeting Process
  list:
    - title: Agenda Setting
      content: At the Open Government PO monthly meeting, any PO can propose topics for POs from various ministries to vote. These topics typically come from proposals that have been raised by more than 5000 people on the Join platform, or proposed by the POs from different ministries. So far, issues that are 'interdepartmental', 'proposed frequently' or issues that involve 'pluralistic views' and 'public concerns' are more likely to be selected.

    - title: Delegate Tasks and Responsibilities
      content: Delegation of the wider work roles is key at the beginning to confirm the coordinators. The coordinators needs to contact the main petitioner, confirm the content of the proposal and the date of the collaborative meeting. Then they need to respond to the initial concern being raised on the Join platform, invite relevant stakeholders, and respond to the results of the meeting. The co-organizers need to attend meetings and provide relevant information.
      img: /assets/images/2 _ 確認分工.png
    - title: Research
      content: The host team should grasp the context of the issue at this time. In the beginning, the PDIS team asks the coordinator to assist in understanding the position of the ministry, whether the representatives of public opinion or non-governmental organizations have concerns, how policies have been discussed in the past, and then compile the analysis of the topic. Then the PDIS team asks the co-organizers to assist in providing relevant research and information, or good articles with different opinions.

      content: Before the meeting, the administrative work such as notification of the meeting, list of attendees, sending out the topic manual, and so on, should also be confirmed. Also, relevant conditions such as seating arrangements, lunch, tea, and live broadcasts should be in place. In terms of topics, expectation management should be carried out by means of an information pack (detailing different aspects of the topic) and other methods before the meeting. During the meeting, the host should align participants' understanding of the issues, and then co-create possible solutions to the core problems with relevant stakeholders.

      content: The Digital Minister who is in charge of Open Government reports to the premier and other ministers after collaborative meetings. If there are useful ideas generated in the collaborative meeting, it will be returned to the Executive Yuan administrative system. If the Executive Yuan does not have a specific ruling or policy objective, the ministries will consider whether the various opinions and ideas collected at the collaborative meetings need to be taken into account. If so, they will be included in the rest of the policy-making process and be dealt with in accordance with the existing administrative procedures.

interview-principles:
  title: Principles for Interviews Before Collaborative Meetings
  preface: There will be different types of people from all sides participating in the collaborative meeting at the same time. In order to save time where the participants clarify each other’s ideas, the host team will make a manual listing the topics of discussion and send it to all of the participants seven days in advance, allowing them to read it before the meeting. Interviews will be conducted with stakeholders from all sides in advance and these will be neutrally and accurately recorded in detail in the topic manual, in order to allow the topic manual to contain as many diverse viewpoints as possible. However, its nature is not a real law. It is a working document that records the common experience. It is expected that users will continue to provide feedback during the practice verification to adjustment.
  content: "<h2>Instructions for the division of labor</h2><ol><li><p>The department will be responsible for all aspects of dividing up the work of the discussion topics at the collaborative meeting, and the department will invite a stakeholder to be interviewed for each topic.</p></li><li><p>The department responsible for inviting stakeholders will be the main interviewer for that interview. Other departments with the same discussion topics can voluntarily register or can become a co-attending unit according to the requirements of the main interview unit. PDIS will view the necessity of each case and decide on the degree of their participation.</p></li><li><p>After the interview, the department will send the records to PDIS, which will collate the records and make them anonymous. PDIS will produce the first draft of the topic manual 10 days before the collaboration meeting, which will be supplemented and confirmed by each department. The topic manual will be sent to all of the participants seven days before the collaborative meeting and will be published along with the verbatim interview transcripts after the meeting.</p></li><li><p>If one of the main or assisting departments has not held an interview before, they can ask a PDIS colleague to demonstrate by serving as the main interviewer for one of the interviews, but the rest of the work for the interviews (such as records, making appointments for interviews, writing interview outlines) must be completed by the main host interviewer unit.</p></li><li><p>The interviews will use a two-tier method in order to obtain more diverse and complete viewpoints. The first tier will be the list of interviewees provided by each department, which will be supplemented by PDIS. The second tier will be the list of people recommended by interviewees from the first tier, in the spirit of promoting diversity of ideas, but the departments can decide for themselves whether or not to interview them. The interviewees from the first and second tiers will be added to the list of invited participants for the collaborative meeting.</p></li></ol><hr /><h2>Tasks for the main interviewer unit:</h2><h3>1. Decide who will be interviewed</h3><p>The interviewees should cover all of the following aspects:</p><ul><li>Supporters of the proposal/those who oppose the suggestions of the proposer, or experts, scholars, and opinion leaders who have other stances on the matter/a member of an interested for for-profit or non-profit organization/people with firsthand experience of the matter/members of government agencies,</li></ul><p>If interviewees are members of government agencies/or representatives of organizations. If they uphold the collaborative meeting’s core ideal of “diversification and explanation of ideas”, interviewees are invited to fully share their ideas no matter whether these are “suggestions from the government/an organization’s position” or “suggestions from an individual interviewee”.</p><h3>2. Making appointments for interviews</h3><p>There are no specific suggestions for time and place, but departments can discuss borrowing the PDIS venue if necessary. They must provide an outline of the interview, a brief introduction of the proposal, and a summary of the collaborative meeting in advance.</p><p>The form of the interviews will be as follows:</p><ul><li>Face-to-face interview: At a place agreed with the interviewee will suffice.</li><li>Telephone interview: At a time agreed with all parties will suffice.</li><li>Written interview: We do not recommend using this method for first tier interviewees.</li></ul><h3>3. Writing the interview outline</h3><p>After the interview outline has been written it must be sent to PDIS, and must be sent out as an attachment to the interview appointment notice by the main interviewer unit. It is recommended that there are at least five or more open-ended questions including, but not limited to, the following:</p><ol><li>Provide an opinion which is in agreement or disagreement with the proposer’s suggestion, as well as other ideas</li></ol><blockquote>  <p>Example: “The demands of the proposer and seconder to levy a tax on empty houses are supposed to carry out so-called ‘residential justice’, and requires the government to raise the ‘holding costs’ of housing. Do you think increasing the holding costs of housing can effectively keep down house prices, or not? Why?”</p></blockquote><ol><li>For suggestions that are collected in advance, put forward opinions, suggest some risks and question whether or not these plans are feasible.</li></ol><blockquote>  <p>Example: “Most of the seconders proposed progressive tax rates based on the number of households held (not limited to empty houses), or the number of days a property is held unused etc., is this proposal feasible? Please share your views.”</p></blockquote><ol><li>Provide your own views on the questions behind the proposal.</li></ol><blockquote>  <p>Example: “The proposer and seconder’s demand to levy a tax on empty houses is supposed to carry out so-called ‘residential justice’, and requires the government to raise the ‘holding costs’ of houses. Apart from increasing holding costs, do you think that there are any other effective methods or government measures that could help to keep house prices down or carry out residential justice?”</p></blockquote><ol><li>Provide suggestions to the interviewee, including the arguments of scholars/groups/individuals in support of or in opposition to the proposal.</li></ol><h3>4. Staff in attendance</h3><ol><li>There should be at least one colleague from the business unit in attendance:<ul><li>They must verify the direction of the interview and write the interview outline. They must also confirm any relevant facts and the overall context during the interview.</li></ul></li><li>There should be at least one PO from each department or a Level Three government official PO in attendance:<ul><li>They must accumulate relevant experience from the interview and understand the topic of discussion.</li></ul></li><li>A PDIS colleague can serve as the interviewer for the first interview when required by the department.<ul><li>PDIS is not required to attend any follow-up interviews (but can provide assistance when necessary).</li></ul></li></ol><h3>5. Recording the interviews</h3><ol><li>The contents of the statements made by the interviewer and interviewee must be recorded in as much detail as possible:<ul><li>Any method which can achieve an almost verbatim record of the process of the dialogue will suffice for recording, there is no need to make any extra corrections.</li><li>Refer to: <a target='_blank' href='https://ey.pdis.nat.gov.tw/shared/J459ZFMUhIlOLrmJ_hsSh6TurZ0RKG5kRtpd7ZPa_G9'>Principle of secret investigation interview - 呂炳宏</a></li></ul></li><li>The records of the interview should be sent to PDIS within three days after the date of the interview.</li></ol><hr /><h2>Sequence of interviews</h2><ol><li>Explain “Why do we need this interview?”:<ul><li>Summarize the content of the proposal.<ul><li>State the headline of the proposal, the methods advocated for by the proposer, and the estimated date and time of the collaborative meeting.</li></ul></li><li>Summarize the collaborative meeting.</li></ul></li><li>Explain the principles of the interview process and recording:<ul><li>The interview process will be recorded, with the written records serving as the main version. There will also be an audio recording of the interview if the participants agree.</li><li>The interview records are for internal reference. They will be made anonymous and entered in the topic manual.</li><li>Before the topic manual is sent out, it will be given to the interviewees to confirm the accuracy of its content.</li></ul></li><li>Proceed with interviews according to, but not limited to, the content of the interview outline.</li><li>Inquire as to whether or not they have any other items that they wish to add.</li><li>Inquire as to whether or not they have any interviewees to recommend.</li></ol><hr /><h2>Reminders for the interview process:</h2><p><strong>1. The purpose of the interview is to gather more information and is not to explain the government’s stance.</strong>The interview process can generally be divided into: listening, clarification, and explanation. During the interview process, there will often be interviewees who do not understand government policies, division of labor, or legislation. It is recommended that you first listen until they are finished, and then continue by clarifying why the interviewee thinks in such a way, until the discussion ends or there is no way to continue, and only then should you enter into the explanation stage.</p><blockquote>  <p>For example: The interviewee believes that levying a tax on empty houses can effectively keep house prices down because an empty house tax would raise the holding costs of empty houses. As a result of this, investors would want to sell the houses as quickly as possible after buying them.</p></blockquote><p>After you have finished questioning them in detail, you should gradually provide facts for the interviewee to consult, and then allow the interviewee to add to their views.</p><blockquote>  <p>For example: There are many kinds of empty houses, some of these are in remote areas, some are old-fashioned houses which are so outdated that they break building regulations, do you have any suggestions or views about this?</p></blockquote><p><strong>2. When asking questions, avoid only asking “yes or no” questions.</strong></p><p>Simple “yes or no” questions have no way of getting any more information out of the interviewee’s answers. Or, after you have asked a “yes or no” question, you should continue by asking the reasons behind this position, or what was it about the current situation which caused them to adopt this position.</p><blockquote>  <p>For example: Do you understand the current system for property tax?  The interviewee can only answer “yes” or “no” to this kind of question, and will not provide any more opinions.</p></blockquote><p><strong>3.  Confirm the definitions of nouns during the interview process.</strong></p><p>Avoid discussions based on different information, as not only will this lower the efficiency of the interview, but during the follow-up process, when you are arranging the information, you could also misinterpret the information gained from the interview.</p><blockquote>  <p>For example: The ways that veterinarians and pharmacists define making up prescriptions are different. Veterinarians believe that making up prescriptions only involves preparing the drugs, while pharmacists believe that making up prescriptions also includes inspecting the content of prescription. </p></blockquote><p><strong>4. During the interview process, take care not to digress from the topic, but use moderate divergences when needed.</strong></p><p>Moderate divergences from the topic can help collect different aspects of information related to the topic.</p><blockquote>  <p>For example: The proposal for ‘Levy a tax on empty houses, which will raise holding costs and release more housing resources from the hands of investors, which will keep house prices down.’  <strong>Discuss the methods for implementing the empty house tax</strong> -> This is in accordance with the content of the proposal.  <strong>Discuss the adjustment of interest rates for mortgages</strong> -> This is in accordance with the part of the proposal relating to holding costs.  <strong>Discuss the charter administration system</strong> -> This is in accordance with the purpose of the proposal, which is ‘to liberate more houses’, but this is a bit of a digression.  <strong>Discuss social housing</strong> -> This is in accordance with the final goal ‘to keep house prices down’, but this is a bit of a digression.  <strong>Discuss reducing pressure on the capital</strong> -> Although this is quite far from the topic, it is in accordance with the goal of the proposal of releasing more housing resources.  <strong>Discuss the area of residences per capita</strong> -> This is the main detail in the method of calculating of house tax based on the number of households, but the issue of holding costs being too low has not yet been settled and is a bit of a digression.</p></blockquote><p><strong>5. When appropriate, during the interview process, you can collate and confirm the interviewee’s main points.</strong></p><p>This step will allow the interviewee to feel respected, and can speed up the completion of the meeting records on the day.</p><blockquote>  <p>For example: When the interviewee has finished giving a long answer to a question, you can confirm with the interviewee whether or not their answer can be summarized according to the following points, and then briefly explain those points.</p></blockquote><p><strong>6. If you feel that what the interviewee is saying is digressing from the topic of conversation, you can ask them to complement what they said by linking it to the main topic.</strong></p>"


reformation:
  title: Open Government Participation Officer Network Reformation
  update_date: Implemented Mar 19, 2020<br/>Amended Apr 20, 2021
  list:
    - title: Each ministry takes turns in proposing topics for voting at collaborative meetings
      points: 
        - To enable ministries to think proactively about incorporating open government elements into their business and to enhance public-private partnerships through collaborative meetings, ministries are required to come up with at least one topic to be voted on at the collaborative meetings each year.
        - In accordance with the “Guidelines for Processing Collaborative Topics in Open Government Collaborative Meetings,” all ministries are allowed to propose topics at collaborative meetings without the need for a vote, but work together with the Public Digital Innovation Space (PDIS) in processing; or they may propose topics for ballot in line with the year’s duty roster schedule, which will be decided at the monthly open government participation officers (PO) work meetings whether to become topics for collaborative meetings.
        - Given the balance between and burden on the ministries, in the case of a month (quarter) when it is a ministry’s turn to present a topic for voting, it may not be required to do so if it has hosted two or more collaborative meetings that year. A duty roster will be drawn up based on the records of ministries hosting collaborative meetings in the past, with those with a higher frequency being placed in the last quarter.
        - The selection of collaborative topics in collaborative meetings is based on the principle that there is a need for inter-ministerial collaboration due to the complexity of the issues at stake, divergent views of multiple parties, and active public participation. In case of deviation from the above guidelines or practical difficulties in collaboration, the PDIS team may, in conjunction with the National Development Council (NDC), discuss and amend the topics with the proposing agency.
        - To give greater impetus to the Open Government National Action Plan, it is suggested that the authorities behind each commitment give priority to the multi-stakeholder forums or other issues necessitating public-private partnerships that are required for the pledges as topics self-proposed or by vote.
        - The collaborative topics in collaborative meetings should involve inter-departmental matters and can be co-sponsored and co-hosted by multiple ministries; and to facilitate business promotion, ministries can swap the rotation months (quarters).

    - title: Take turns to be a table leader at collaborative meetings
      reason: Given that the integration of the open government concept and operational methods can only be achieved through practical implementation, ministries are required to have their POs or staff rotate a table leader twice a year in collaborative meetings, so as to sharpen their chairing and interpretation skills required for dialogue with multiple stakeholders. The table leader's rotation may be made with the chair of the collaborative meetings.
    - title: Reinforce feedback review mechanism for collaborative meetings
      reason: After the collaborative meeting, the PDIS team will invite the hosting/co-hosting POs to review the process of organizing the collaborative meeting and provide feedback and suggestions for improvement in both directions. Should a suggestion for improvement be of a general nature or involve policy, it will be considered to be brought up at the PO monthly work meetings, with the minutes of the meeting taken to be published, or the ministers without portfolio asked to coordinate with the relevant officials.
    - title: Commendations for significant open government cases 
      reason: In view of the substantial contribution made by POs or staff of the ministries in handling significant open government cases, <u>the PDIS team will sign a letter requesting their respective agencies to give commendations to staff rendering meritorious service</u> for significant and difficult cases.
    - title: Staff responsible for a significant open government task are allowed to devote themselves to the assignment within a certain time limit
      reason: Should the PO in charge and staff be distracted by their day-to-day business from working on a major open government case, the PDIS team may coordinate with their respective agencies, as necessary, to allow them to focus on that task for a specific period of time.
    - title: The PDIS team assists agencies in promoting open government on multiple fronts
      points:
        - The PDIS team has prepared the "Open Government Collaborative Meetings - A Teaching Guide" to assist agencies at all levels, through the provision of relevant courses, to understand the concept of open government, learn about the operation and mechanism of collaborative meetings, and integrate public-private partnership elements into their daily business. The PDIS team will continue to prepare and provide information on relevant lesson plans and render necessary assistance to authorities in their open government operations.
        - In addition to organizing relevant courses or meetings, if there is a need for popularization or the identification of a target group in the agencies, the POs of all ministries may invite the ministers without portfolio to deliver lectures or courses in person, provided that a full program is planned and accompanied throughout.
